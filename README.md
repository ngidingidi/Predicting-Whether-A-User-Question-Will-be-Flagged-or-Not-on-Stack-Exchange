# Predicting-Whether-A-User-Question-Will-be-Flagged-or-Not-on-Stack-Exchange

The goal of this project was to extract questions users posted on Stack Overflow's parent website, Stack Exchange and use machine learning to predict whether a posted user question would be flagged or not. This was part of a 4 week data science series organized by the Portland Data Science Meetup group in which data science enthusiasts got together and worked on this project.

In this notebook, I used various machine learning classifiers to predict whether a user question would be flagged or not on Stack Exchange.

I found that artificial neural networks slightly outperformed Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines classifiers
